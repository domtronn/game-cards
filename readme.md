## Getting Started

```
npm install
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Update the `config.json` to include the two API keys for
[igdb.com](https://www.igdb.com/) and
[wall.alphacoders](https://wall.alphacoders.com).

To get the API keys, create accounts and request an API key from them.

# Local development
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` to get the dependencies
3. Install [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) globall if you haven't already (`npm install -g nodemon`)
4. Run `npm run develop` (this will start the server and restart if any changes are detected)
